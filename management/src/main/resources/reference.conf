    # Definition of management route providers which shall contribute routes to the management HTTP endpoint.
    # Management route providers should be regular extensions that additionally extend the
    # `org.apache.pekko.management.scaladsl.ManagementRoutesProvider` or
    # `org.apache.pekko.management.javadsl.ManagementRoutesProvider` interface.
    #
    # Libraries may register routes into the management routes by defining entries to this setting
    # the library `reference.conf`:
    #
    # pekko.management.http.routes {
    #   name = "FQCN"
    # }
    #
    # Where the `name` of the entry should be unique to allow different route providers to be registered
    # by different libraries and applications.
    #
    # The FQCN is the fully qualified class name of the `ManagementRoutesProvider`.
    #
    # By default the `org.apache.pekko.management.HealthCheckRoutes` is enabled, see `health-checks` section of how
    # configure specific readiness and liveness checks.
    #
    # Route providers included by a library (from reference.conf) can be excluded by an application
    # by using "" or null as the FQCN of the named entry, for example:
    #
    # pekko.management.http.routes {
    #   health-checks = ""
    # }
    routes {
      health-checks = "org.apache.pekko.management.HealthCheckRoutes"

    # Should Management route providers only expose read only endpoints? It is up to each route provider
    # to adhere to this property
    route-providers-read-only = true
  }

  # Health checks for readiness and liveness
  health-checks {
    # When exposing health checks via Pekko Management, the path to expose readiness checks on
    readiness-path = "ready"
    # When exposing health checks via Pekko Management, the path to expose readiness checks on
    liveness-path = "alive"
    # All readiness checks are executed in parallel and given this long before the check is timed out
    check-timeout = 1s
    # Add readiness and liveness checks to the below config objects with the syntax:
    #
    # name = "FQCN"
    #
    # For example:
    #
    # cluster-membership = "org.apache.pekko.management.cluster.scaladsl.ClusterMembershipCheck"
    #
    # Libraries and frameworks that contribute checks are expected to add their own checks to their reference.conf.
    # Applications can add their own checks to application.conf.
